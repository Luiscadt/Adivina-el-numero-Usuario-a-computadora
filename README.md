# Adivina-el-numero-Usuario-a-computadora

This code allows the user to play a game of "Guess the Number" with 3 lives. The program starts by printing a welcome message and prompting the user to enter a limit number for the range of numbers to guess from.

The function `adivina_el_numero` generates a random number between 1 and the limit entered by the user. The user is then prompted to enter a number between 1 and the limit, and the program checks whether the input is higher or lower than the random number generated. The user has 3 lives, and if they don't guess the correct number within those lives, they lose the game.

If the user guesses the correct number, the program prints a message congratulating them on their win. This game provides an entertaining way to practice guessing numbers and can be a fun challenge for users of all ages.

Overall, this code shows the power of Python in creating interactive games that users can enjoy and learn from.
